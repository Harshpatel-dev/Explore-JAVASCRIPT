- The equality operater checks whether two operands are equal,returning a Boolean value(True OR False).Unlike Strict Equality(===)
it converts both operands to same type if not.Means Stict Equality always returns False,both operands are of different type.

If the operands have the same type, they are compared as follows:
Object: return true only if both operands reference the same object.
String: return true only if both operands have the same characters in the same order.
Number: return true only if both operands have the same value. +0 and -0 are treated as the same value. If either operand is NaN, return false; so, NaN is never equal to NaN.
Boolean: return true only if operands are both true or both false.
BigInt: return true only if both operands have the same value.
Symbol: return true only if both operands reference the same symbol.

If one of the operands is null or undefined, the other must also be null or undefined to return true.

convertion happens before comapring as follows
*binaryAndString - both converted into number
*numberAndString - string converted into number
